    <h1> Ruana: the cloak. </h1>
    <p> 
      <strong>Ruana</strong> is basically a cloak made out of rectangular or a square fabric. 
    It's a lot like poncho, but it has additional cut made through one side. </p>
    <p> It's a lot easier to do and at the same time it seems like 
    <strong><a href="https://youtu.be/ZfaPo-zFZz8">the most effective cloak</a></strong>. </p>
    <p> When it comes to wearing it, there are plenty of options to choose from. </p>
